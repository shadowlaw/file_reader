# file_reader
a console application that reads a text file and displays its content on the screen.

The application will accept three parameters:
1. a limit on the number of characters that can be put on one line (i.e.
line width)
2. whether the application should break on words or characters,
3. how the characters on each line should be aligned i.e. left-,
center- or right-aligned.
